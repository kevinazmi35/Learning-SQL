# Learning-SQL
For this database I did the top 5 players in points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, steals per game, and blocks per game. 
As there were a couple of players in the top 5 for more than one category, I have only added their name(s) once. 
If sorted by column, the top five will be shown and will contain the rest of the players as well.
